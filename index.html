                <p class="p-4">It is no surprise that volatility is the new normal.
                    Fast-paced changes, new
                    competitions,macro-economic uncertainties, and technology-enabled disruptions are making the terrain
                    more
                    complex. But in these highly volatile scenarios, as individuals and as an organisation, how should
                    we become more agile and dynamic?
                    I realized that what stalls agility are internal barriers such as unclear decision making, outdated
                    organisational norms, lack of lateral communication, and most importantly risk-averse culture. We
                    have to become more agile as a culture and a company and that means that each one of us has to
                    become more active in our approach. This also means that we need to start wiring this into the
                    processes and how we measure success.
                    We certainly have to experiment more and be okay with making some mistakes. That’s the only way we
                    will be able to innovate faster and better. Also, more familiar we become with the industries,
                    communities, countries, people, and larger ecosystems around us, more likely we are to understand
                    and adapt changes. Some of our traditional, multi-layered decision-making processes also needs to
                    change along with simplifying the processes. We also need to delegate more and encourage our team
                    members to become accountable by giving them more autonomy.
                    I hope to see all of you demonstrating agility as one of the key strengths.
                    Before pausing here, I extend my heartfelt new year wishes to you and your family. May we grow more
                    and learn the most.</p>
